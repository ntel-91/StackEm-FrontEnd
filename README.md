StackEm is a single player game mimicking tetris functionality. A player logs in to an account, clicks start, and stacks as many blocks as possible until reaching the top of the tetris board. One point is added for each tetris block stacked. Your score is the number of blocks stacked.

Your highest score is saved and displayed next to the testris board, along with your score to previous games.
